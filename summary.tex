\subsection{Routing Protocols}
\subsubsection{RIPv1 \& RIPv2}
\paragraph{}
RIP is a \textit{distance vector} protocol, the only widely used routing protocol that uses the distance vector protocol today.
\paragraph{}
RIPv1 was defined as a \textit{classful} protocol. Therefore it does not advertise subnet mask information and assumes the default subnest mask based on the class of the network.
\paragraph{}
When a router starts up, it will automatically add the connected networks to its routing table, denoting them with a \verb!C!.
If RIP is enabled, the router broadcasts its routing table. Neighbouring routers router with RIP enabled will receive the broadcast update and add the routes to their own routing tables.
Each RIP enabled router will broadcast its routing table this way, therefore the routing table will converge accross the network.

\subsection{Network Security}
\subsubsection{Security Introduction}
\paragraph{}
Internet and networks are becoming more complex and mission critical. Through the recent years there has been an intergration of network infrastructures.
As a matter of fact, no computer system in the world can be completely secure no matter how good the security measures are. Probably the only way to fully secure a computer is to isolate it completely, restricting all physical and virtual access to it. Such a system would not be connected to any network and would probably be stored in a secured vault somewhere with no physical access
\paragraph{}
Cisco IOS software running on Cisco routers has several built-in security tools that can be used as part of a good overall security strategy. Probably the most important security tool in Cisco IOS software are access control lists (ACL)
\begin{description}
	\item[C] Confidentiality - prevents acces to sensative information
	\item[I] Integritiy - prevents unauthorized modification of data
	\item[A] Availability  - prevents the loss of acces to information
\end{description}
\paragraph{}
In a medium to large enterprise, the typical secured network is built around a recipe of a perimeter router, a firewall device, and an internal router.
\begin{description}
	\item[Perimeter Router] Is the border between enterprise resources and the public network (internet)
	\item[Firewall] Firewall
	\item[Internal Router] Availability  - prevents the loss of acces to information

\subsection{IPv6}
\subsubsection{IPv6 Introduction}
\paragraph{}
Due to the shortcomings of IPv4, the Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) has been created.
The main reason for migratig TCP/IP networks from IPv4 to IPv6 is the avaiable address space.
While IPv4 uses a 32-bit address, IPv6 uses a 128-bit address.
The change from IPv4 to IPv6 also impacts other protocols as well (\textit{OSPFv3, EIGRPv6, etc.}).
\paragraph{}
Just like IPv4, the main objective of IPv6 is to enable devices to forward packets through multiple routers so they arrive at the correct destination.
However, IPv6 contains a number of differences over IPv4:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Larger address space;
	\item Auto-configuration;
	\item The IPv6 header is \textit{not} similar to the IPv4 header;
	\item Extension headers/options;
	\item Authentication and privacy;
	\item Flow labels (\textit{QoS}).
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{}
There are thee types of IPv6 addresses:
\begin{description}
	\item[Unicast] Unique address for each interface.
	\item[Anycast] Multiple interfaces, packets are send to one (\textit{nearest}).
	\item[Multicast] Multiple interfaces, packets are send to all.
\end{description}
\begin{textbox}{green}{Key Concept}
	IPv6 broadcast addresses are special case of multicast addresses.
\end{textbox}
\paragraph{}
An IPv6 address is a 128-bit value, displayed as 8 groups of 4 hexadecimal digits.
For example: \verb!2001:0DB8:0000:0000:0006:0600:300D:527B!.
Leading zeros can be left out: \verb!2001:DB8:0:0:6:600:300D:527B!, one or more adjecent groups
of 16 bit of zeros can be replaced with the \verb!::! symbol (\textit{once!}): \verb!2001:DB8::6:600:300D:527B!.
\paragraph{}
IPv6 provides tow similar options for unicast addressing:
\begin{description}
	\item[Global Unicast] Similar to public IPv4 addresses. These addresses are allocated by the IANA. Each company is assigned a unique IPv6 address block called a \textit{global routing prefix}. Global Unicast addresses make up the majority of IPv6 addresses.
	\item[Unique Local] Similar to private IPv4 addresses. Can by used by when behind a IPv6 NAT and in networks that aren't connected to the internet.
\end{description}
\paragraph{}
IPv6 addresses can be identified by the initial bits of the address:
\begin{tabular}{@{}l@{}l@{}l@{}}
\textit{Address Type} & \textit{Binary Prefix} & \textit{IPv6 Notation} \\
Unspecified                       & %
        \verb!000…0 (128 bits)!   & %
        \verb!::/128!             \\
Loopback                          & %
        \verb!000…1 (128 bits)!   & %
        \verb!::1/128!            \\
Multicast                         & %
        \verb!1111 1111!          & %
        \verb!FF00::/8!           \\
Link-Local Unicast                & %
        \verb!1111 1110 10!       & %
        \verb!FF80::/10!          \\
Global Unicast                    & %
        \textit{everthing else}   & %
        \textit{everthing else}
